Today’s Learning – HashMap (JavaScript)

Today I worked on understanding HashMap / HashTable from scratch using JavaScript.

I learned how a hash table stores data in the form of key–value pairs and how a hash function converts a key into an array index. I implemented a simple hash function using the modulo operator to map keys to specific indexes.

I created a HashTable class and implemented the following operations:

Insert – to store key-value pairs in the hash table

Get – to retrieve values using a key

Search – to find a value by iterating through the table

Delete – to remove a value using its key

While implementing this, I also understood:

How array size affects hashing

Why hash functions are important

How data is stored internally in a hash table

The limitation of my current implementation (no collision handling yet)

This practice helped me clearly understand the basic working of HashMaps and strengthened my fundamentals in Data Structures using JavaScript.
Next, I plan to learn collision handling techniques like chaining and open addressing.
